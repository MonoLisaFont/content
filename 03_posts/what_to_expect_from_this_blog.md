We have been developing MonoLisa typeface for the past few years. A while ago we realized that during this time we have attained a lot of typeface related expertise. The purpose of this blog is to share our learnings and help you get into the world of fonts. Expect most of our posts to be short and to the point.

In case you have specific ideas on what topics to cover, [please open a discussion at our GitHub repository](https://github.com/MonoLisaFont/feedback/discussions/categories/ideas) as that will help to shape the content.
