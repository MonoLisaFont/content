TODO: Change blog post title to “Why should I pay for a typeface?”

Sometimes we are confronted with the question ‘Why should I pay for a font when there are free ones out there?’.

## Why are some typefaces not free of charge? They are just digital after all and could be copied endlessly...

A good typeface is a well made product and it takes time, energy and knowledge to build and maintain it. Compare it to a book, a car, a delicious dish in a restaurant – you would not expect to get it for free. All the products you can think of are made by people like yourself and - after all – money does’t grow on trees. Some companies like Google can afford to offer free products and services (because they make their money by showing you ads). Some free typefaces are fun or side projects or a bait to attract customers to the main product. XXXXXXXX THis needs more content from Andrey or Juho maybe????? XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

## Why is MonoLisa a paid typeface?

To create a typeface without a client is always a lottery. Often it pays off in the long run, sometimes people are just not thrilled and you find yourself having wasted a lot of time. To build the first version of MonoLisa took around 18 months of (unpaid) design work. Luckily MonoLisa turned out to be popular very quickly. 

We do not consider it a by-product we could just give away. Since 2020 we meet online every two weeks to discuss how to tackle issues you brought up in our feedback channel or how we proceed to better the typeface and the website in general. 

Some people ask why MonoLisa is so expensive. Well, it’s actually not. Looking at prices for font families (i.e. at Myfonts) that are as well-built as MonoLisa you will find our offer is wthin this price range (and we are offering fast support and updates). Also as a professional you can deduct the costs from your tax burden. ((((((it that the case in the US?))))) 

## Conclusion

some more input here please XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX: [more information can be found at MonoLisa website](https://monolisa.dev).
