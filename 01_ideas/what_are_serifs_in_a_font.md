You may have noticed that some typefaces have theses tiny legs or bars and some don’t. Those bars are called serifs. 

## the past

You can find serifed text on statues from the roman empire. You may have already used or seen a typeface called Trajan. The letter shapes are taken from a 2000 year old column in Rome that commemorates emperor Trajan's victory in the Dacian Wars – so much for history. A serifed font of this kind is also called ‘Antiqua’. With the invention of mechanical typewriters slab serifs became common. Those serifs have approximately the same stroke width as the letter shape itself. Prominent examples are Roboto Slab or Courier. These typefaces are sometimes called ‘Egyptienne’.

## The present

If they are so old why do we still use them? Studies show that serifed typefaces are easier to read in long printed text. That’s why practically every book or magazine uses serif fonts for longer texts. Studies also seem to indicate that that is not necessarily the case on screens. Let’s not leave monospaced fonts unmentioned: The i, j, r and l usually have serifs. But that does not make the typeface itself a serifed font. Their function is solely to occupy as much space as possible since these letters would be too narrow without them and would create too big gaps in the text.

## Your future

Serifs in monospaced fonts are rare but important. Please have a look how MonoLisa uses them to make reading easier: [more information can be found at MonoLisa website](https://monolisa.dev).
