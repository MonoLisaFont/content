A ligature is a combination of two or more glyphs. They form a new glyph which replaces the glyphs they are representing.

## Letter combinations

Common ligatures are `fi` and `ft` in text fonts. Other examples are the well known ampersand `&`, the european nordic letters `Æ`,`Œ` and the German letter `ß`. There are no limits to create new ligatures out of letters in the design process.

## Coding ligatures

A popular trend are coding ligatures. While some do not appreciate them, they can make a code look more fluent and point out certain commands visually more elegant. Usually they are a combinations of mostly punctuation signs, ampersands, brackets and the like. To create these ligatures python scripting is necessary, since the ligatures need to keep the fixed width whilst displaying several symbols in a row.

## Conclusion

Coding ligatures are a fun and elegant way to visually structure your code. See what the ligatures look like in MonoLisa: [more information can be found at MonoLisa website](https://monolisa.dev).
