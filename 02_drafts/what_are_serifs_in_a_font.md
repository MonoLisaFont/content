You may have noticed that some typefaces have tiny legs or bars attached to their glyphs and some don’t. Those bars are called serifs. In this post, we’ll describe what serifs are and why you might want to use them or avoid using them altogether in your designs.

## History of serifs

Serifs go back to the Roman Empire. If you pay attention near the status from the era, you will notice that the text used looks specific as it is using serifs. Typeface called Trajan, illustrated below, is a good example showing how serifs affect text. The letter shapes of the typeface were taken from a 2000 year old column in Rome that commemorates emperor Trajan's victory in the Dacian Wars. A serifed font of this kind is also called `Antiqua` and you can find more typefaces like Trajan behind the term.

With the invention of mechanical typewriters slab serifs became common. Those serifs have approximately the same stroke width as the letter shape itself. Prominent examples are Roboto Slab or Courier shown below. These typefaces are sometimes called ‘Egyptienne’.

## Why are serifs in use still?

If serifs are so old why do we still use them? Studies show that serifed typefaces are easier to read in long printed text. That’s why practically every book or magazine uses serif fonts for longer texts. Interestingly enough, studies also seem to indicate that that is not necessarily the case on screens.

Monospaced fonts used typically by programmers include serifs of their own as usually the letters i, j, r and l usually have serifs. But that does not make the typeface itself a serifed font. Their function is solely to occupy as much space as possible since these letters would be too narrow without them and would create too big gaps in the text.

## Conclusion

Although serifs go way back, they have made it to this day and continue to be relevant. Now that you know what serifs are about, you cannot unsee them.
