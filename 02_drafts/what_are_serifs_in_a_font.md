You may have noticed that some typefaces have tiny legs or bars attached to their glyphs.
These visual elements, serifs, have a specific purpose, and in this post, we will discuss the history of serifs, when you might want to use them, and when to avoid them in your designs.

## Why were serifs invented?

It has been speculated that the first serifs were invented out of necessity.
Suppose you look at statues from the Roman era.
In that case, you might notice their usage of serifs as the visual elements were used as terminators to allow easier cutting of characters into stone.
You would cut the serif end first so that the remaining cuts would terminate neatly.
In other words, serifs likely exist because of practical reasons.
Since then, the original characters used by the Romans were modeled as a typeface called [Trajan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan_(typeface)) pictured in the image below.
Trajan borrowed the characters from a roughly 2000-year-old column in Rome commemorating emperor Trajan's victory in the [Dacian Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan%27s_Dacian_Wars).

The idea of serifs was further refined by the [Antiqua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiqua_(typeface_class)) class of typefaces, which was invented in the Middle Ages as an evolution of [Fraktur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraktur).
The main innovation was how glyphs were constructed in a continuous manner, and Antiqua borrowed ideas from earlier work by the Romans.

[Baskerville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baskerville) is an example of a transitional serif typeface from the 1750s.
It modernized older shapes, and the typeface is still prevalent in book design.
Since its introduction, Baskerville has been extended by adding a bold-variant.

Further evolution of serifs occurred in the 19th century as [Slab Serif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slab_serif) was introduced.
The development of Slab Serif was motivated by the prevalence of printing technologies where each character had to be modeled on its own.
In contrast, individual letters still had to flow together when combined.
Good examples of this category of typefaces are Egyptienne, Rockwell, and Courier.
Note that each of these typefaces has a fixed width by definition and can, therefore, be considered to be monospaced as they always occupy the same amount of width.

## Why are serifs still in use?

If serifs are such an old invention, why do we still use them?
The simple answer is that serifs [may be more legible](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4612630/) as they provide hints for readers to allow faster comprehension.
A classic example is to pick up a typeface and consider characters, such as "l", "I", "1".
Leaving serifs out leads to a design challenge in communicating the difference between the characters.
Unfortunately, it is not always this straightforward as [other studies](https://geniusee.com/single-blog/font-readability-research-famous-designers-vs-scientists) imply that sans serif (read: "without serif") can be the more legible option for children.
The same applies to people with low vision, and the same applies even to digital displays.

Serifs have their uses, especially in print and programming.
The main benefit is that they allow a font designer to effectively address differences between characters.
It is even possible to selectively apply ideas from serifs to sans serif fonts to address specific design problems related to specific characters (i, j, r, and l are good examples).
In monospaced fonts, serifs allow occupying space to avoid creating too large gaps between characters since the available space is fixed to a certain width.

## Bonus serif - flare serifs

Although it is not considered a real serif, the so-called flare serif is an interesting special case as it achieves a similar effect by varying width without introducing a serif.
[Optima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optima) is a good example of a typeface implementing this technique.

## Conclusion

Serifs go way back, and they still have their uses even today.
Although you might not use them consistently, they have specific strengths, and they can be instrumental in monospaced typefaces to improve the legibility of characters through additional hints to allow faster character recognition, not to mention the space-filling benefits of serifs.
Now that you know what serifs are, it isn't easy to unsee them.
