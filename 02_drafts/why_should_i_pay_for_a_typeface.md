Sometimes we are confronted with the question ‘Why should I pay for a font when there are free ones out there?’.

{/*
JV: Proposed intro below

There are a lot of typefaces out there and many of them are freely available. You can access some only by licensing them to your use. The question is, why would you pay for a typeface or a font when you can get one for free? That is the question we will explore in this post.

## Why are some typefaces not free of charge? They are just digital after all and could be copied endlessly...

## Why do paid typefaces exist?
*/}

A good typeface is a well made product and it takes time, energy and knowledge to build and maintain it. Compare it to a book, a car, a delicious dish in a restaurant – you would not expect to get it for free. All the products you can think of are made by people like yourself and - after all – money does’t grow on trees. Some companies like Google can afford to offer free products and services (because they make their money by showing you ads). Some free typefaces are fun or side projects or a bait to attract customers to the main product. XXXXXXXX XXXMore content from Andrey or Juho maybe?????XXX

Designing a typeface takes a considerable amount of time. For each typeface, you have to design a set of characters and the more languages you want to support, the more work you have to do. Add features, like ligatures or variable axes, and that increases the amount of work needed. It is here that you often see tradeoffs as a typeface might be missing specific features or characters altogether. The question is, who is going to pay for all this work?

Sometimes the work is subsidized by a company, such as Apple or Google, and they hire a designer to implement a typeface for them as a project to support their branding. That is not the only model, however, as specific font foundries exist that create custom fonts for smaller companies and consumers. To offset the cost of design, they often price these special typefaces so that you can purchase a license to a font within a typeface or access to the whole typeface. Typically the more you want to license, the more expensive it is.

Compared to free alternatives, often paid typefaces come with features that are not available in the free options and they may come with a support model to take your requests into account. Technically one model is to develop a font and then release and forget it, but for some typefaces, like MonoLisa, support is included and your requests shape the development of the typeface.

## Why is MonoLisa a paid typeface?

To create a typeface without a client is always a lottery. Often it pays off in the long run, sometimes people are just not thrilled and you find yourself having wasted a lot of time. To build the first version of MonoLisa took around 18 months of (unpaid) design work. Luckily MonoLisa turned out to be popular very quickly.

We do not consider it a by-product we could just give away. Since 2020 we meet online every two weeks to discuss how to tackle issues you brought up in our feedback channel or how we proceed to better the typeface and the website in general.

Some people ask why MonoLisa is so expensive. Well, it’s actually not. Looking at prices for font families (i.e. at Myfonts) that are as well-built as MonoLisa you will find our offer is within this price range (and we are offering fast support and updates). Also as a professional you can deduct the costs from your tax burden. XXXX is that the case in the US? XXXX
