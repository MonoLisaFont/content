In everyday communication the terms ‘font’ and ‘typeface’ are often used synonymously but actually they have different meanings. Read what the difference is and why a distinction makes sense when you talk about typographic matters.

In everyday communication the terms ‘font’ and ‘typeface’ are often used synonymously but actually they have different meanings. In this post, we explain why the distinction makes sense when you talk about typographic matters and you will look smarter to your friends when you can use the terms correctly.

## Typefaces are a family business

Usually a typeface is a family or collection of styles and weights. Let’s take ‘Helvetica’ – everybody knows what you mean when you mention it. When you just say Helvetica you are talking about a typeface.
But if you want to specify you add – for example – ‘Bold Italic’ to it you. That specific weight or style is called a font. To specify even more there are categories like upright, italic, wide, narrow, condensed, compressed, etc. In general fonts can be regarded as the family members of a typeface which is the hierarchically higher term.

JV: I would split this up as follows.

Bluntly, a typeface is a family or collection of styles and weights. As an example, consider Helvetica, a typeface known by many. When you say Helvetica, you refer specifically to a typeface as a collection of fonts. If you pointed to Helvetica Bold Italic, you would refer to a specific instance of it - a font.

TODO: Add examples here to show the difference

To make things more complex, there are more categories beyond bold and italic. To give more examples, consider upright, wide, narrow, condensed, compressed etc. Each variant, or combination, is a font of its own. In general fonts can be regarded as the family members of a typeface which is the hierarchically higher term.

TODO: Maybe discuss variable fonts briefly as a solution to above?

## Why is that important?

If you want to be typographically exact knowing the difference between those two terms helps communicate correctly with designers and shows that you are a pro.

## Conclusion

Have a look what styles and weght MonoLisa has to offer or maybe you are interested in the whole ... typeface: [more information can be found at MonoLisa website](https://monolisa.dev).

JV: I would drop the CTA and expand a notch.

Although it might sound trivial, typefaces and fonts do have a difference. If you want to be typographically exact knowing the difference between those two terms, you can communicate correctly with designers and show that you are a pro.
