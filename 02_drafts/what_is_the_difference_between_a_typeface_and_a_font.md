In everyday communication the terms ‘font’ and ‘typeface’ are often used synonymously but actually they have different meanings. Read what the difference is and why a distinction makes sense when you talk about typographic matters.

## Family business

Usually a typeface is a family or collection of styles and weights. Let’s take ‘Helvetica’ – everybody knows what you mean when you mention it. When you just say Helvetica you are talking about a typeface.
But if you want to specify you add – for example – ‘Bold Italic’ to it you. That specific weight or style is called a font. To specify even more there are categories like upright, italic, wide, narrow, condensed, compressed, etc. In general fonts can be regarded as the family members of a typeface which is the hierarchically higher term.

## Why is that important?

If you want to be typographically exact knowing the difference between those two terms helps communicate correctly with designers and shows that you are a pro.
