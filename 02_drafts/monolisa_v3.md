MonoLisa is a font family, or a typeface, that has been in development since 2020. Over five thousand software developers have adopted it since as their font of choice. Now with version 3, the family expands yet again and in this post we show you how the font has evolved now to cover design tasks as well. It is quite rare that a typeface receives continuous care and effort from its creators but here we are still at it six years later.

## Versions one and two

The first version published in 2020 included a monospaced version aimed specifically at developers. The key point of version one was to offer a slightly wider monospaced font as this made it easier to design wide characters, such as "m".

The second major version released on 2022 went a notch further in a form of redesign enabling variable weight. In other words, it became possible to make the font as thick or thin as you like since sometimes that's all you need to squeeze out that last bit of legibility. The introduction of variability also made the font useful for web related tasks as by shipping a variable version to your client, you can access all its weights without having to deliver multiple files.

The second version also included what we call a customization tool that lets you **freeze** font features since many editors and other applications available today have limited options on how to access your font features. Freezing solved this problem as it literally froze font features, such as specific characters, directly to the font itself thereby working around limitations of software.

## Version 3 – the family grows

Now with version 3, the family grows with a new member besides MonoLisa Code, the original typeface. The new font family called **MonoLisa Text** covers the other half of common usage where monospaced version doesn't fit so well. In other words, MonoLisa Text is a **proportional** family designed for use cases where you might have regular text and therefore completes the family while working as a complementary pair to the original version. This makes it ideal for use cases, such as prose, potentially user interfaces, and web design where you want a nice pairing.

The introduction of MonoLisa Text makes the type family useful beyond developers as now it covers a wide range of **design** tasks making it a handy tool for designers to wield in their arsenal. Besides this major addition, we have made series of smaller changes that expand the usefulness of the original MonoLisa Code.

## Version 3 – other changes

To keep this short, we have listed the main changes for MonoLisa Code below (also available in the change log). *TODO: Link to the official change log from here. One option would be to push this information there potentially.*

**Letters, including a, b, d, p, q, and similar, have been adjusted to be more sharp and distinct.**

*TODO: Include a visual comparison here*

**Selected letters in the light master have been widened.**

*TODO: Include a visual comparison here*

**Vertical metrics have been adjusted to allow easier usage in a UI context.**

*TODO: Include a visual example here before and after*

**Script variant letter shapes have been revised and optimized further.**

*TODO: Include a visual example here before and after*

In addition, we have done the following changes:

* We reorganized and cleaned up stylistic sets so the order makes sense again
* Figure seven (7) with a middle stroke was introduced as ss14
* Plain zero (no center) was introduced as ss15. In MonoLisa Text, the variant is a dotted zero instead for legibility reasons.
* MonoLisa Code only – coding related ligatures were moved behind character variants (cvXX) to allow easy adjustability
* The support for Greek language was extended and the support for Armenian, Braille, and Hebrew has been added
* In addition numerous smaller adjustments were made across the typeface

## New website

As we worked with the additions to the typeface, we realized it's not enough to only update only the font, but the website has to be made to fit it and showcase the new features well. Compared to the earlier one, you will likely notice that sections, such as the landing page or specimen, have received major updates. We also had to make sure the customization tool works with the new additions.

## Availability of version 3 with MonoLisa Text

*TODO: Describe new packages here and the route to them from older plans*

## Conclusion

We hope you enjoy the new major version of the typeface! It represents a considerable amount of effort from our part and we hope you try it at least! *TODO: The CTA here is to pitch people to trial if they haven't tried the font before or to update as described above*
